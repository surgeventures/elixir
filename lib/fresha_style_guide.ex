defmodule FreshaStyleGuide do
  @moduledoc """
  Official style guide for Elixir and Phoenix projects at Fresha.

  The guidelines are written in a form of Elixir functions with `@doc` attributes describing their
  reasoning and providing examples with syntax highlighting. They're divided into modules that wrap
  guidelines into categories with a summary that consists of one-liner descriptions for all of them
  (highly useful during code reviews!). All in all, using this format makes this guide familiar,
  readable and easy to contribute for all Elixir developers.

  All guidelines in this guide aim to provide a consistent, convention-driven coding experience and
  an easily readable, maintainable code as a result. It's divided into the following modules:

  - `FreshaStyleGuide.CodeStyle`: basic code style and formatting guidelines
  - `FreshaStyleGuide.SoftwareDesign`: higher level application design and engineering guidelines
