  Indentation must be done with 2 spaces.

  ## Reasoning

  This is [kind of a delicate subject](https://youtu.be/SsoOG6ZeyUI), but seemingly both Elixir and
  Ruby communities usually go for spaces, so it's best to stay aligned.

  When it comes to linting, the use of specific number of spaces works well with the line length
  rule, while tabs can be expanded to arbitrary number of soft spaces in editor, possibly ruining
  all the hard work put into staying in line with the column limit.

  As to the number of spaces, 2 seems to be optimal to allow unconstrained module, function and
  block indentation without sacrificing too many columns.

  ## Examples

  Preferred:

      defmodule User do
        def blocked?(user) do
          !user.confirmed || user.blocked
        end
      end

  Too deep indentation (and usual outcome of using tabs):

      defmodule User do
          def blocked?(user) do
              !user.confirmed || user.blocked
          end
      end

  Missing single space:

      defmodule User do
        def blocked?(user) do
          !user.confirmed || user.blocked
       end
      end

  """
  def indentation, do: nil

  @doc """
  Lines must not be longer than 100 characters.

  ## Reasoning

  The old-school 70 or 80 column limits seem way limiting for Elixir which is highly based on
  indenting blocks. Considering modern screen resolutions, 100 columns should work well for anyone
  with something more modern than CGA video card.

  Also, 100 column limit plays well with GitHub, CodeClimate, HexDocs and others.

  ## Examples

  Preferred:

      defmodule MyProject.Accounts.User do

  There must be no space put before `}`, `]` or `)` and after `{`, `[` or `(` brackets.

  ## Reasoning

  It's often tempting to add inner padding for tuples, maps, lists or function arguments to give
  those constructs more space to breathe, but these structures are distinct enough to be readable
  without it. They may actually be more readable without the padding, because this rule plays well
  with other spacing rules (like comma spacing or operator spacing), making expressions that combine
  brackets and operators have a distinct, nicely parse-able "rhythm".

  Also, when allowed to pad brackets, developers tend to add such padding inconsistently - even
  between opening and ending in single line. This gets even worse once a different developer
  modifies such code and has a different approach towards bracket spacing.

  Lastly, it keeps pattern matchings more compact and readable, which invites developers to utilize
  this wonderful Elixir feature to the fullest.

  ## Examples

  Preferred:

      def func(%{first: second}, [head | tail]), do: nil

  ## Reasoning

  Like with brackets, it may be tempting to pad negation to make it more visible, but in general

  they usually have precedence over binary operators and padding them away from their argument makes
  this precedence less apparent.

  Indentation blocks should be padded from surrounding code with single blank line.

  ## Reasoning

  There are probably as many approaches to inserting blank lines between regular code as there are
  developers, but the common aim usually is to break the heaviest parts into separate "blocks". This
  rule tries to highlight one most obvious candidate for such "block" which is... an actual block.

  Since blocks are indented on the inside, there's no point in padding them there, but the outer
  parts of the block (the line where `do` appears and the line where `end` appears) often include a
  key to a reasoning about the whole block and are often the most important parts of the whole
  parent scope, so it may be beneficial to make that part distinct.

  In case of Elixir it's even more important, since block openings often include non-trivial
  destructuring, pattern matching, wrapping things in tuples etc.

  ## Examples

  Preferred (there's blank line before the `Enum.map` block since there's code (`array = [1, 2, 3]`)
  in parent block, but there's no blank line after that block since there's no more code after it):

  ## Reasoning

  There's often more than one way to achieve the same and the difference is in fitting things
  horizontally through indentation vs vertically through function composition. This rule is about
  preference of the latter over the former in order to avoid crazy indentation, have more smaller
  functions, which makes for a code easier to understand and extend.

  ## Examples

  Too much crazy indentation to fit everything in one function:

  Multi-line calculations should be indented by one level for assignment.

  ## Reasoning

  Horizontal alignment is something especially tempting in Elixir programming as there are many

  good when the pipe "comes out" from the initial value. In order to achieve that in assignment,
  vertical alignment is often overused.

  The issue is with future-proofness of such alignment. For instance, it may easily get ruined
  without developer's attention in typical find-and-replace sessions that touch the name on the left

  Hence this rule, which is about inserting a new line after the `=` and indenting the right side

  Keywords in Ecto queries should be indented by one level (and one more for `on` after `join`).

  ## Reasoning

  Horizontal alignment is something especially tempting in Elixir programming as there are many

  often written (and they do look good) when aligned to `:` after `from` macro keywords. In order to
  achieve that, vertical alignment is often overused.

  The issue is with future-proofness of such alignment. For instance, it'll get ruined when longer
  keyword will have to be added, such as `preload` or `select` in queries with only `join` or

  It's totally possible to adhere to the 2 space indentation rule and yet to write a good looking

  Per-function usage of reuse directives should be preferred over module-wide usage.

  ## Reasoning

  If a need for `alias`, `import` or `require` spans only across single function in a module (or
  across a small subset of functions in otherwise large module), it should be preferred to declare
  it locally on top of that function instead of globally for whole module.

  Keeping these declarations local makes them even more descriptive as to what scope is really
  affected. They're also more visible, being closer to the place they're used at. The chance for
  conflicts is also reduced when they're local.

  ## Examples

  Preferred (`alias` on `Users.User` is used in both `create` and `delete` functions so it's made

  Calls to reuse directives should be placed in `use`, `require`, `import`,`alias` order.

  ## Reasoning

  First of all, having any directive ordering convention definitely beats not having one, since they
  are a key to parsing code and so it adds up to better code reading experience when you know
  exactly where to look for an alias or import.

  This specific order is an attempt to introduce more significant directives before more trivial
  ones. It so happens that in case of reuse directives, the reverse alphabetical order does exactly
  that, starting with `use` (which can do virtually anything with a target module) and ending with
  `alias` (which is only a cosmetic change and doesn't affect the module's behavior).

  ## Examples

  Preferred:

      use Helpers.Thing import Helpers.Other alias Helpers.Tool

  Out of order:

      alias Helpers.Tool
      import Helpers.Other
      use Helpers.Thing

  Calls to reuse directives should not be separated with blank lines.

  ## Reasoning

  It may be tempting to separate all aliases from imports with blank line or to separate multi-line
  grouped aliases from other aliases, but as long as they're properly placed and ordered, they're
  readable enough without such extra efforts. Also, as their number grows, it's more beneficial to
  keep them vertically compact than needlessly padded.

  ## Examples

  Preferred:

      use Helpers.Thing
      import Helpers.Other
      alias Helpers.Subhelpers.{
        First,

  RESTful actions should be placed in `I S N C E U D` order in controllers and their tests.

  ## Reasoning

  It's important to establish a consistent order to make it easier to find actions and their tests,
  considering that both controller and (especially) controller test files tend to be big at times.

  This particular order (`index`, `show`, `new`, `create`, `edit`, `update`, `delete`) comes from
  the long-standing convention established by both Phoenix and, earlier, Ruby on Rails generators,
  so it should be familiar, predictable and non-surprising to existing developers.

  ## Examples

  Preferred:

      defmodule MyProject.Web.UserController do
        use MyProject.Web, :controller

        def index(_conn, _params), do: raise("Not implemented")

        def new(_conn, _params), do: raise("Not implemented")

        def create(_conn, _params), do: raise("Not implemented")

        def edit(_conn, _params), do: raise("Not implemented")

        def update(_conn, _params), do: raise("Not implemented")

        def delete(_conn, _params), do: raise("Not implemented")
      end

  Different (CRUD-like) order against the convention:

      defmodule MyProject.Web.UserController do
        use MyProject.Web, :controller

        def index(_conn, _params), do: raise("Not implemented")

        def new(_conn, _params), do: raise("Not implemented")

        def create(_conn, _params), do: raise("Not implemented")

        def show(_conn, _params), do: raise("Not implemented")

        def edit(_conn, _params), do: raise("Not implemented")

        def update(_conn, _params), do: raise("Not implemented")

        def delete(_conn, _params), do: raise("Not implemented")
      end

  > The issue with CRUD order is that `index` action falls between fitting and being kind of "above"
    the *Read* section and `new`/`edit` actions fall between *Read* and *Create*/*Update* sections,
    respectively.

  Documentation in `@doc` and `@moduledoc` should start with an one-line summary sentence.

  ## Reasoning

  This first line is treated specially by ExDoc in that it's taken as a module/function summary for
  API summary listings. The period at its end is removed so that it looks good both as a summary
  (without the period) and as part of a whole documentation (with a period).

  The single-line limit (with up to 100 characters as per line limit rule) is there to avoid mixing
  up short and very long summaries on a single listing.

  It's also important to fit as precise description as possible in this single line, without
  unnecessarily repeating what's already expressed in the module or function name itself.

  ## Examples

  Preferred:

      defmodule MyProject.Accounts do
        @moduledoc \"""

  Documentation in `@doc` and `@moduledoc` should be written in ExDoc-friendly Markdown.

  Here's what is considered an ExDoc-friendly Markdown:

  - Paragraphs written with full sentences, separated by a blank line

  - Headings starting from 2nd level heading (`## Biggest heading`)

  - Bullet lists starting with a dash and subsequent lines indented by 2 spaces

  - Bullet/ordered list items separated by a blank line

  - Elixir code indented by 4 spaces to mark the code block

  Exceptions should define semantic struct fields and a custom `message/1` function.

  ## Reasoning

  It's possible to define an exception with custom arguments and message by overriding the
  `exception/1` function and defining a standard `defexception [:message]` struct, but that yields
  to non-semantic exceptions that don't express their arguments in their structure. It also makes
  it harder (or at least inconsistent) to define multi-argument exceptions, which is simply a
  consequence of not having a struct defined for an actual struct.

  Therefore, it's better to define exceptions with a custom set of struct fields instead of a
  `message` field and to define a `message/1` function that takes those fields and creates an error
  message out of them.

  ## Examples

  Preferred:

      defmodule MyError do
        defexception [:a, :b]

        def message(%__MODULE__{a: a, b: b}) do

      end

      raise MyError, a: 1, b: 2

        def exception({a, b}) do
          %__MODULE__{message: "a: #{a}, b: #{b}"}

  Pipe chains must be aligned into multiple lines.

  > Check out `Surgex.Guide.CodeStyle.assignment_indentation/0` to see how to assign the output from

  ## Reasoning

  This comes from general preference of vertical spacing over horizontal spacing, expressed across
  this guide by rules such as `Surgex.Guide.CodeStyle.block_alignment/0`. This ensures that the code
  is readable and not too condensed. Also, it's easier to modify or extend multi-line chains,
  because they don't require re-aligning the whole thing.

  By the way, single-line chains look kinda like a code copied from `iex` in a hurry, which is only
  fine when the building was on fire during the coding session.

  Modules referenced in typespecs should be aliased.

  ## Reasoning

  When writing typespecs, it is often necessary to reference a module in some nested naming
  scheme. One could reference it with the absolute name, e.g. `Application.Accounting.Invoice.t`,
  but this makes typespecs rather lengthy.

  Using aliased modules makes typespecs easier to read and, as an added benefit, it allows for an
  in-front declaration of module dependencies. This way we can easily spot breaches in module
  isolation.
